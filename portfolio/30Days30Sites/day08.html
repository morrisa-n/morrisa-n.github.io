                    <p>With his distinctive art style, incredible talent, and tragic life story, Dutch post-Impressionast painter Vincent van Gogh has been captivating art lovers for well over a century. Though his life was short, his iconic works left a lasting impact, bringing joy&mdash;sometimes tinged with grief&mdash;and artistic inspiration into countless lives.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>Van Gogh was a prolific artist, creating thousands of pieces of art, including around 860 oil paintings. He was also deeply troubled, plagued by poverty and the dark side of his own mind, and in 1890, van Gogh took his own life. But fortunately, his work lives on, and likely will for generations to come.</p>
