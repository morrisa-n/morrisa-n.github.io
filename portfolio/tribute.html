<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>One of the <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> assignments is to build a tribute page for something. So I built a tribute to someone I've been missing for a while. His name was Wally, he was thirteen, and he was an incredible dog who was taken far too soon.</p>
<p>Anyone who says a pet is "just a pet" is wrong. He still holds a huge place in my heart, and I couldn't <em>not</em> pay tribute to my beloved "Doot Doot".</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to let your heart do the driving.</p>
