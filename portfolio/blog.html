<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I was intrigued by the idea of a blog made from Jekyll and GitHub pages. With the assistance of <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this tutorial</a>, I set up a basic blog for myself, then set out to tailor it more to my personality and my needs as a blogger. I wanted a layout that combined my love of bright colors, nature, and bold, chunky fonts. Once I found the photograph of the rainbow mug on <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cup-top-view-coffee-table-vintage-2315554/">Pixabay</a>, I knew I had found the base for my layout.</p>
<p>The site layout is built entirely from CSS. I also used FontAwesome's icons, and a dash of Bootstrap here and there.</p>
