        <h2>Wally "Doot Doot" Neely</h2>
        <h2 class="light">May 12, 2002 - June 22, 2015</h2>           
            <p>Dogs can teach us a great deal about kindness. Wally was one of the best teachers. For thirteen years, the chihuahua gave his family lessons in joy, love, and bravery. If you ever needed a hug or a kiss, he was always there, ready to give them. He lived a long life for a dog, and was given as much love as he gave, but he wasn't given as much time in this world as he deserved. Forever wouldn't have been enough time.</p>
            <p><div class="pics"><a href="./photos/birthday.jpg"><img src="./photos/birthday.jpg" /></a></div>Wally adored toys. He was given so many that he expected to receive a new one every time his family returned home. They tried to trick him by washing older toys, hiding them, and then giving them back to him, but it was no use. Wally was too clever to fall for that trick. He recognized every single one. His favorites were a large stuffed duck with a squeaker inside, and a stuffed football that also had a squeaker.</p>
            <p>He was also a singer. The US National Anthem and Elvis's "Blue Christmas" were his particular favorites, but if you just told him to sing, he'd make up a song of his own. He loved the outdoors, and had a favorite corner in the back of the yard that he always visited. And every morning, he'd demand more attention by pawing at the living room rug until it was in disarray, while making huffy little noises and wagging his tail like he was having the time of his life.</p>
            <p>Wally was preceeded in death by his cranky but endearing older brother, Poncho, in 2007. He is survived by his two eight-year-old siblings, Pandora and Peanut.</p>
