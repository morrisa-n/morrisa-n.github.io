<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>When you're online as often as I am, you often run into someone posting about the temperature where they're at. Or maybe you want to share the temperature where you're at. But what if you use Fahrenheit and they use Celsius, or vice versa, and you can't remember how to convert one to the other?</p>
<p>That's what the Friendly Temperature Converter is for. It's just a simple little script that converts one temperature to another, and it does it with a smile. Because we could all use a few more smiles in our lives. :)</p>
