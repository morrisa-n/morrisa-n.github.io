<div class="segment">
<p>My name is Morrisa Neely. People always misspell my name, but I'm used to it. ;) I'm an aspiring web dev from the tiny town of Centerville, TN. I'm currently teaching myself to code through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>, and more. Not the easiest thing to do when you're still on dialup internet in the 2010's, but I love it.</p>

<p>I also love the internet. I've been in love with the internet since I was a preteen. Every week, I used to beg my parents to take me to the local library to use their internet connection, so I could look up spoilers for my favorite TV shows and read ALL THE THINGS. Then we finally got internet at home, and I've been <em>really</em> hooked ever since.</p>

<p>Since the 2000's, I've been picking up bits and pieces of HTML and CSS knowledge. I've tweaked the styles of message boards and online communities I've been an administrator of, countless blogs and blog posts, several personal <a href="https://userstyles.org/">Stylish</a> styles, and, of course,&mdash;like so many in my age group&mdash;the ubiquitous MySpace page. And now, I'm going to go even further: I'm learning to be a web developer.</p>

<p>So why did it take so long for me to start making a dedicated effort to learn code? Mental health.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I've struggled with some level of anxiety. Not the kind where you're just a little nervous about everything, but the kind that can wreck large swathes of your life. I had trouble making friends, even though I genuinely like people and want great things for them. I didn't hit a lot of milestones at the same time as my peers&mdash;didn't go to college until I was 21 (and then had to withdraw because of my illnesses), didn't learn to drive until recently, never held a job. Then the generalized anxiety disorder invited its good friend major depressive disorder. For a long time, I was busy fighting a war with my own mind. And I was almost certain I'd lose.</p>

<p>I didn't lose. I found the right combination of meds and therapy, and I got my life back&mdash;I got my <em>brain</em> back. I'm not 100% better, and I know I may never be able to call myself "cured." But I <em>am</em> better, and I'm determined to learn. I'm determined to improve my life through one of mankind's greatest inventions: the Internet. And I'm not going to let my lack of money, my ancient dialup internet connection, or my mental illness stop me.</p>

<p>Join me as I chart my progress toward gaining mad web dev skillz. There might be gratuitous chihuahua pics, occasional bouts of fiction writing (there's a reason this blog is called "<em>Writer</em> Cracks the Code"), and absurd amounts of loose leaf tea. Maybe even baked goods.</p>
