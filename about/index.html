<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an aspiring web dev from the tiny town of Centerville, TN. I'm currently teaching myself to code through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>, and more. Not the easiest thing to do when you're still on dialup internet in the 2010's, but I love it.</p>
