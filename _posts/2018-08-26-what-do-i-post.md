***What do I post?*** It's a question that's plagued every attempt I've ever made at starting a blog.

I've probably made at least a dozen attempts at starting a blog over the years, under various usernames and on many platforms. I've done LiveJournal and various spinoffs, Blogspot, the free version of WordPress, the blogging equivalent on the late social network Imzy, MySpace, probably a few free web hosts, and now this one.

And I still never know what to post. I call myself a writer, and I don't know how to write about myself.

That's why most of my blog posts have titles like "Reset" and "Hitting the Restart Button." Even when I'm actively learning, my blog falls by the wayside&mdash;perhaps *especially* when I'm actively learning. I'll get distracted by lessons and notetaking and sometimes actually building things, and next thing you know my blog du jour ends up looking like a spooky old house with cobweb curtains, a bunch of ghosts, and tumbleweeds blowing through the front yard. Thanks to the magic of computers, you can't see all the dust gathered on that rainbow cup I'm using as the background of my page.

It doesn't help that I don't know if anyone's actually reading this thing.

Maybe I should post about what I'm going to be doing (or have done) on a particular day? Let's try that. Today I'm going to finish Codecademy's [Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) course. I'm up to the Advanced CSS Grid lessons. A lot of the course has been a review, but CSS grid is pretty new to me. I'd like to implement some of what I've learned on here at some point.

Once I've finished with the CSS course, I'm planning on doing a little more on the [Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) course. I'm 57% of the way through that one. Or I'll do some more of SoloLearn's [Ruby tutorial](https://www.sololearn.com/Play/Ruby/). I don't feel like I'm really *learning* Ruby with either of them, but I'm not viewing them as actual courses anyway. They're an introduction. Once I've been "introduced," I'll get to know Ruby, become friends with it. But not yet. Like any friendship, this takes time.

I guess that's how I should view my relationship with my neglected blog: as something that takes time.
