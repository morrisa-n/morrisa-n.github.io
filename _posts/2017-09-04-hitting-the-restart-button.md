So, it's September already somehow? Since when? That doesn't seem right. I swear it was July just a few days ago.

I've been gone from this thing&mdash;and my coding adventures&mdash;for too long. I fell woefully behind on 100 Days of Code, 30 Days 30 Sites, updating my Twitter account, all of it. But I'm still around. I'm always lurking somewhere on the internet...*always*...

So. Updates? I got my driver's license around the end of July. I'm a car owner now. I'm 29 years old now, which doesn't sound accurate, but okay. I guess if my birth certificate says I should be 29 now, then I must be 29.

Also, I applied for some jobs yesterday&mdash;first time I've ever applied for any job. I think I've mentioned before that I'd be searching for non-software jobs in the near future. I was waiting for vocational rehab to come through with something for me, but I got tired of waiting. Anyway, one of the jobs I applied to is at Petco, another is at a pet resort. Both involve dogs, and I'm a total dog person (I love cats too!). I figure I can tolerate a *lot* of stuff if I'm also getting to interact with dogs and other animals. I mean, I'm one of those people who gets all mushy over them.

I don't have any professional experience working with dogs, but I can't remember ever being without at least one dog. And I feel like the bond between a pet and its loving owner is one of the most powerful forces out there. I mean, here's this innocent being that doesn't speak the same language as you and never will, that looks nothing like you and never will, that's not even the same species as you, and yet you learn to understand each other and love each other despite your profound differences. That's huge. That's beautiful.

I'm not planning on abandoning learning to code, even if I do get one of these jobs. I enjoy coding. It's a ton of fun, and it's something I still want to know more about.

That's it for now, I think. In the meantime, I'm going to get back into finishing 30 Days, 30 Sites projects, then tackle Daily CSS Images, and wait to hear *something* from either of the businesses I applied to.
