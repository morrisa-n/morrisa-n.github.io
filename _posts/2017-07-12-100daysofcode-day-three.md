Not as much done today as I would've liked. Had to go get my fake teeth adjusted a bit. As you can see, I tweaked the CSS on here a bit. I also did a little more tweaking of my YouTube video page clone for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video?ref=lnav) (code [here](https://github.com/morrisa-n/Odin-Project/tree/master/Projects/youtube)&mdash;I'm really not pleased with the code so far, and feel like it could be a *LOT* better...but I'm not quite there in my skills yet).

Tomorrow I'll do better. And it's almost tomorrow already. ;)
