Day Two of my attempt at [#100DaysofCode](http://100daysofcode.com/). This is my second time trying to do it. The first was toward the end of this June, but that ended up getting cut short by some major dental work&mdash;turns out getting nine teeth extracted and seven of those being replaced by a so-called "immediate denture" is very, very painful. Who knew?

...okay, I sort of had an idea it would be very painful, at least. It wasn't my first tooth extraction rodeo. I've been dealing with bad teeth for years. I'm not even thirty yet, and I've got my first denture now. Genetic lottery winner right here, baby. \*points at self\*

Anyway. Day Two. Today's efforts have mostly been spent on this blog. I'm not happy with the layout, since it's not much different from the tutorial I used to make the blog, but I am happy that I *finally* got around to setting this thing up. Now I just need to make it more personal, add tags, and maybe add a few more custom touches and thingies.
