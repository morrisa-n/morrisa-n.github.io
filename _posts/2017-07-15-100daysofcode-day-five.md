Most of yesterday's effort went into setting up a [portfolio](/portfolio). I don't really have much to put in a portfolio, but it was a good opportunity to do more experiments with HTML and CSS. I also used a dash of Bootstrap&mdash;with my own special touches, of course&mdash;which was interesting to play with. And sometimes frustrating, when I couldn't get some layout-y things to do what I wanted.

The end result, though? It was worth it. I don't know about anyone else, but I think my blog *and* portfolio layouts are both pretty. They're simple, but I like them.

I also managed to get a local copy of the blog running on my computer, which has made adjusting this thing a LOT more convenient.
