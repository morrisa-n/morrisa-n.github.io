So, I signed up for the [#30Days30Sites](https://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites) challenge Saturday. First assignment? Build my portfolio. What had I just done on #100DaysOfCode Day 5? Built my [portfolio](/portfolio). So I built a second portfolio just for the challenge. [This](/portfolio/30Days30Sites) is what I ended up with.

Why circles? Because the rest of the world does rectangles in their galleries and portfolios and whatnot. I like being different. And circles are fun! (And thank goodness for stuff like Bootstrap, which makes the circles easy.)

30 Days, Day Two: I made a digital [wedding invitation](/portfolio/30Days30Sites/day02.html) for an imaginary couple. Also fun.

And yesterday, I signed up for [Daily CSS Images](http://dailycssimages.com/), a challenge to make images using only CSS. Day one was today, I made a [bear cub](/portfolio/DailyCSSImages/day01bearcub.html), and it was&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;a lot of fun.

I'm hoping by the end of these challenges, I'll be better at HTML and CSS, a better designer in general, and maybe able to slip more Javascript into the stuff I'm building. And it'll be nice to have more things to put in my portfolio.
