It's been a few days since I last updated. Oops. I've actually been busy with my 100 Days of Code and 30 Days, 30 Sites stuff. Then there was a break in 30 Days stuff after Day 5, so I decided to get started on Javascript...again.

This is my second attempt at learning Javascript. The first was back at the beginning of 2016, and it didn't really click for me then. I ended up not sticking with it. Now I feel like it just wasn't the right time in my life for me to learn it. Sometimes it seems like you have to do other things before you become fully receptive to something new, you know? Funny how life works like that.

Anyway. Today I finished Codecademy's [Learn Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-javascript) course. It's too short, IMO, even for a complete beginner's course&mdash;or perhaps especially for a complete beginner's course.
