Updating a day late, but better late than never, am I right?

Day Four of #100DaysOfCode mostly involved a battle between this blog's footer and me. As you can see from the possibly-glaring absence of a footer, I was not successful. The footer will return once I figure out how to get it to stay down at the bottom, no matter what size the rest of the content is (not in a fixed position way, but in a way that doesn't leave a gap between it and the bottom of the page).

I haven't given up. I'm just taking a break to "lick my wounds" before taking another stab at the footer.

I also changed the colors and the background on here&mdash;I wanted something with more color. I love color. I'm the type of person who wears long, lemon-yellow coats with bright pink scarves. I love rainbows, sparkles, all of it. I used to paint, even, but that's expensive, so I had to find other creative outlets. I felt my blog should reflect that part of me, which is what drew me to the rainbow cup photograph on Pixabay.

ANYWAY. I also did another essential bit of computer work yesterday: I cleaned my keyboard. And I started poking at a resume, which is pretty hard to make when you've never been employed anywhere.

For Day Five, I'm either going to switch gears and find another HTML/CSS tutorial to work on, or try to figure out how to add tags to my blog posts. Haven't decided yet.

That's all for now, my lovelies. &hearts;
